ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nora!

ðŸŽ“ I am currently pursuing dual academic programs: **Computer Science at Uppsala University** and **Data Engineering at Nackademin YH**, with a graduation target of May 2025. I have successfully completed the theoretical portion of my Data Engineering program at Nackademin with the highest grades (VG in all courses).

ðŸ’» My academic journey has allowed me to work on exciting projects, including:
- Building an **ETL pipeline** using **Apache Spark** and **MongoDB** to process NYC taxi data, incorporating advanced metrics like trip segmentation and tip ratios.
- Designing a **serverless data pipeline** with **Microsoft Azure services**, automating IoT-like sensor data ingestion and processing for real-time analysis.
- Developing a **batch processing pipeline** for large datasets, integrating **Azure Synapse Analytics** for advanced querying and analysis.

ðŸ”§ I am proficient in **Python**, **SQL**, and **Java**, with hands-on experience in tools like **Azure Data Factory**, **Databricks**, and **Power BI** for data visualization.

ðŸš€ Passionate about turning data into actionable insights, I am eager to tackle challenging projects and contribute to innovative solutions. Letâ€™s connect and create something impactful!
